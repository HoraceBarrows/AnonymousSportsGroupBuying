# Anonymous Sports Group Buying Platform

A privacy-preserving sports equipment group purchasing platform powered by Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology on Ethereum Sepolia testnet.

## üéØ Overview

This decentralized application enables users to participate in group buying of sports equipment while maintaining complete privacy of their purchase quantities and amounts. Built with FHE technology, all sensitive transaction data is encrypted on-chain, ensuring that neither merchants nor other buyers can access individual purchase information.

## üîê Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

The platform leverages Zama's FHE technology to enable computations on encrypted data without decryption. This means:

- **Encrypted Orders**: Purchase quantities and amounts are encrypted before being stored on-chain
- **Private Aggregation**: The smart contract can compute total orders and collected amounts without revealing individual contributions
- **Selective Revelation**: Only the buyer can decrypt and reveal their specific order details when needed

### Anonymous Group Purchasing

Traditional group buying platforms expose purchase patterns and quantities, potentially revealing:
- Individual spending habits
- Bulk purchase strategies
- Competitive intelligence for businesses

Our FHE-based approach ensures:
- **Quantity Privacy**: Your purchase amount remains encrypted
- **Price Privacy**: Payment amounts are only visible to you
- **Pattern Protection**: No one can analyze your buying behavior
- **Fair Participation**: All participants benefit from group discounts without information asymmetry

## üìù How It Works

### Step 1: Product Creation
A merchant or coordinator creates a group buying campaign:
```javascript
createProduct(name, description, unitPrice, minQuantity, maxQuantity, category, deadline)
```

### Step 2: Encrypted Order Submission
Buyers place orders with encrypted quantities:
```javascript
// Quantity is encrypted client-side before submission
placeOrder(productId, encryptedQuantity)
```

### Step 3: Privacy-Preserving Aggregation
The smart contract:
- Accumulates encrypted orders
- Computes total participants (public)
- Checks if minimum threshold reached (public)
- Keeps individual quantities private (encrypted)

### Step 4: Selective Revelation
When needed, buyers can:
- Decrypt their own order details
- Prove their participation
- Request refunds if minimum not met

## üéì Educational Resources

### Understanding FHE
Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows computations on encrypted data. In this platform:
- Addition of encrypted values (total quantity calculation)
- Comparison operations (threshold checks)
- Conditional logic (campaign success/failure)

All without ever decrypting sensitive user data!

### Privacy Benefits
Traditional group buying reveals:
- ‚ùå Individual purchase amounts
- ‚ùå Timing of purchases
- ‚ùå Coordination between buyers

FHE-based approach protects:
- ‚úÖ Quantity privacy
- ‚úÖ Amount privacy
- ‚úÖ Participation patterns

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **Multi-tier Pricing**: Automatic price adjustments based on encrypted total quantity
- **Reputation System**: Privacy-preserving buyer/seller ratings
- **Cross-chain Support**: Expand to other EVM chains with FHE support
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile experience with WalletConnect
- **Advanced Analytics**: Zero-knowledge proofs for aggregate statistics

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This is a testnet deployment for demonstration purposes
- Do not use real funds on mainnet without thorough auditing
- FHE operations may take longer than standard transactions
- Sepolia testnet required for full functionality
